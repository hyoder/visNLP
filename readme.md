## Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly relevant in our data-driven world and is being implemented widely today due to the abundance of natural language data. However, mastering NLP processes is not a simple task, particularly for those without a comprehensive background in the field. Further, the use of neural networks in many commonly used NLP approaches makes it difficult to interpret the input-output relationships of these models, creating the "black-box" problem in data science. To address these challenges, we develop and implement a web-based interactive visual NLP learning platform that enables learners to study some fundamental neural network-based NLP techniques, topics, and applications. Specifically, the technical contribution of this work is threefold: (1) To present popular neural network-based NLP analytics methods in a step-by-step linear format that is easy to comprehend. (2) To eliminate the 'black box' problem found in neural network-based NLP learning resources by providing continuous real-data examples. (3) To enable users to interpret model outputs through interactive visual demos that apply neural network-based NLP method outputs.
