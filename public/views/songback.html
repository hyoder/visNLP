            <h2>Word2vec as a Song Curation Application</h2>

            <p>With music moving into the stremaing era, music has become more accessible than ever. With such large 
                catalogs of music being available, music streaming platforms such as Spotify, and Apple Music have to 
                curate songs that are taylored towards specific a specific user's interests. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Word2vec is a neural network-based approach that can learn high-quality word embeddings from large amounts
                of text data. These embeddings represent the semantic and syntactic relationships between words, allowing 
                them to capture the meaning and context of the words. By applying this technique to music data, it is 
                possible to learn representations of songs that capture their musical features and characteristics.</p>
            
            <!-- Content Sec - How it works -->
            <h2>How Our Model Works</h2>

            <p>To create a song curation application using word2vec, song titles and their respective artist names are input
                into the word2vec code in the form of a csv file, with each song title and associated artist name being read as one word. These 
                inputs are then transformed into vector embeddings through the word2vec algorithm.
            </p>

            <p>These newly produced vecotr embeddings are then compared using cosine similarity, a measure of the angle between 
                two vectors in high-dimensional space. By calculating the cosine similarity between each pair of song title vectors,
                the model is able to determine the most similar songs based on their semantic meaning.                          
            </p>

            <h2>Cosine Similarity Clustering</h2>
            <img src="assets/song_tsne_plots/clustering.png" alt="clustering plot" width=100% height="600"/>
            <p>Song2vec is a machine learning model that uses the word2vec algorithm to generate vector embeddings as representations 
                for song titles and artist names. By calculating the cosine similarity between these vectors, the model is able to 
                determine the most similar songs based on their semantic meaning. Given a certain song title input, Song2vec can 
                produce a list of the top ten most similar songs as output, along with a tsne scatterplot to visualize the vector locations. 
                This makes Song2vec a powerful tool for music recommendation and exploration, allowing users to discover new music based on their preferences.
